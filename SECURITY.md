## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email the maintainer or use GitHub's [Private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/fingerfly/goja/security/advisories/new) if available.
3. Include a description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce.

We will respond within a reasonable timeframe and will credit you in the advisory if the report is valid and not already known.
